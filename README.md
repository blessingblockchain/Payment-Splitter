# Payment-Splitter

I must credit Rhahn for this project. I learned how to build this splitter from his [repo](https://github.com/rhahn28/Profit_Splitter_Smart_Contracts/tree/master).

This contract splits payment among the executives in a Web3 company. I learned how to divide the `msg.value` into percentage and rational proportions. Even though this contract might look simple, it adds to my knowledge no doubt.

## Hire me for freelance technical writing jobs!

Anyone who has followed my journey so far will understand I've been working aggressively on my development skill, even though I am a senior technical writer. I can craft high-quality technical content for your Web3 company due to my wealth of experience.
